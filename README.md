I don't know how I could've made such a boneheaded mistake, but for some reason, before today I thought this assignment was due NEXT week.  On top of that, I had an incredibly busy week last week with things outside of class(work / preparing for my baby to be born in the next 3 weeks), causing me to fall behind.  I've been putting all my spare time into catching up, but there's still a lot I haven't quite been able to grasp.  I was hoping to schedule a session with a tutor before the homework was due, but unfortunately, it's too late for that.  I'm hoping there is a possibility of a make-up assignment as I just started this after class today.  I've been working non-stop, but there was so much I needed to revisit before even starting to code. Sorry, this is really embarrassing!
